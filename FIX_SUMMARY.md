# Upload Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The document upload was failing with a "failed to fetch" error because the backend couldn't start properly.

## Root Cause
The `requirements.txt` file was using the old `pinecone-client==6.0.0` package, which has been renamed to `pinecone`. When the backend tried to import from `pinecone`, it threw an exception stating that the package had been renamed.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated requirements.txt**: Changed `pinecone-client==6.0.0` to `pinecone>=5.0.0`
2. **Reinstalled dependencies**: Uninstalled `pinecone-client` and installed the new `pinecone` package
3. **Restarted backend**: Started the backend server properly using the virtual environment

## Current Status âœ…
- **Backend**: Running on `http://localhost:8000`
- **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Vector Service**: Initialized and ready (using Pinecone)
- **API Health**: All endpoints operational

## Testing the Upload Feature

### 1. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Sign Up / Login
- Click "Sign Up to Get Started"
- Create an account or login with existing credentials

### 3. Upload a PDF Document
- Navigate to the document upload section
- Drag and drop a PDF file or click to browse
- Click "Upload & Process Document"
- The system will:
  - Extract text from the PDF
  - Create semantic chunks
  - Generate vector embeddings
  - Store in Pinecone vector database
  - Save metadata in Supabase

### 4. Perform Semantic Search
- After uploading documents, use the search feature
- Enter a query about the content of your documents
- The system will find semantically similar chunks across all your documents

## API Documentation
View all available endpoints at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Verify Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "supabase_configured": true,
    "vector_service_configured": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-25T05:46:43.841263"
}
```

## Key Endpoints
- `POST /documents/upload` - Upload and process PDF documents
- `POST /documents/search` - Semantic search across documents
- `GET /documents` - List user's documents
- `DELETE /documents/{document_id}` - Delete a document
- `GET /vector-stats` - Get vector database statistics

## Environment Variables
Make sure you have these configured:
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_KEY` - Your Supabase anon/public key
- `PINECONE_API_KEY` - Your Pinecone API key (already configured in backend)

## Next Steps
1. Try uploading a PDF document
2. Search for content within your documents
3. View the semantic search results with similarity scores
4. Check the vector database stats to see how many chunks are stored

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:
1. Check that both servers are running (frontend on 3000, backend on 8000)
2. Verify you're logged in to the application
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Check backend logs at `/Users/raasin/Desktop/LEXAI/backend/server.log`

## Technical Details
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (serverless, free tier)
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 characters with 200 character overlap
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity
