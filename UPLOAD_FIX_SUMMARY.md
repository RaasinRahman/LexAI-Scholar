# Upload Issue Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Environment Variable Handling**
- Added support for both uppercase `PINECONE_API_KEY` and lowercase `pinecone_api_key` in the backend
- This ensures the Pinecone API key is loaded regardless of case sensitivity

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling & Logging**

#### Backend (`backend/main.py`):
- Added detailed console logging throughout the upload process:
  - ✓ File read confirmation
  - → Processing steps
  - ✓ Success checkpoints
  - ⚠ Warnings for non-critical issues
- Added full stack traces for debugging
- Improved error messages to be more specific

#### Frontend (`LexAIScholar/components/PDFUpload.tsx`):
- Enhanced validation with specific error messages:
  - "No file selected"
  - "Not authenticated. Please log in first."
  - "Authentication token missing. Please try logging in again."
- Added console.log statements for debugging:
  - File details
  - Token information (first 20 chars)
  - Upload progress
  - Error details

#### API Client (`LexAIScholar/lib/api.ts`):
- Added comprehensive logging for:
  - Upload URL
  - File details
  - Response status
  - Error details
- Better error parsing and reporting

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Verify Both Services are Running

Backend:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "supabase_configured": true,
  "vector_service_configured": true,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

Frontend:
```bash
# Should be accessible at http://localhost:3000
# Check browser console for any loading errors
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Tools

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the "Console" tab
4. Keep this open while testing

### Step 3: Test Upload

1. **Log in** to your account (or sign up if you haven't)
   - Make sure you see your user info displayed
   
2. **Select a PDF file** to upload
   - File must be under 50MB
   - Must be a valid PDF file

3. **Click "Upload & Process Document"**

4. **Monitor the logs**:
   - **Browser Console** will show:
     ```
     Starting upload: yourfile.pdf
     File size: 12345 bytes
     Using token: eyJhbGc...
     Uploading to: http://localhost:8000/documents/upload
     Upload response status: 200
     Upload successful: {...}
     ```
   
   - **Backend Terminal** will show:
     ```
     Upload request from user: user-id-here
     ✓ File read: yourfile.pdf (12345 bytes)
     → Processing PDF: yourfile.pdf
     ✓ PDF processed: 15 chunks, 5000 characters
     ✓ Generated document ID: abc-123-def
     → Storing 15 chunks in vector database...
     ✓ Vectors stored: 15
     → Storing metadata in Supabase...
     ✓ Metadata stored in Supabase
     ✓ Upload complete: yourfile.pdf
     ```

### Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Not authenticated. Please log in first."
**Solution**: 
- Sign out and sign in again
- Check if your session expired
- Clear browser cache/cookies and try again

#### Issue: "Authentication token missing"
**Solution**:
- This means the Supabase session is not properly configured
- Check `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-key"
  ```
- Restart the frontend server after changing .env.local

#### Issue: "Vector service not configured"
**Solution**:
- Check backend `.env` file has:
  ```
  PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-key"
  ```
- Restart the backend server
- Run health check to verify: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

#### Issue: "Failed to parse error response"
**Solution**:
- Backend server might not be running
- Check CORS configuration
- Verify API_URL in frontend matches backend address

### Step 5: View Uploaded Documents

After successful upload:
1. The document should appear in your Document Library
2. You can search it using the Semantic Search feature
3. Check the "Vector Stats" to see total document count

## Additional Debugging

### View Backend Logs
```bash
# If running with redirect
tail -f backend/server.log

# Or watch the terminal where backend is running
```

### Check Network Tab
1. In Browser DevTools, go to "Network" tab
2. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
3. Try uploading again
4. Click on the `/documents/upload` request
5. Check:
   - Request Headers (should include Authorization)
   - Response (shows error details if failed)

### Test with cURL
```bash
# First, get your access token from browser console after logging in
# (it will be printed when you try to upload)

# Then test upload:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/test.pdf"
```

## Environment Check

Run this to verify your configuration:
```bash
# Check backend env
cat backend/.env | grep -E "SUPABASE|PINECONE"

# Check frontend env
cat LexAIScholar/.env.local | grep -E "SUPABASE|API"
```

## Need More Help?

If the issue persists:
1. Copy the **complete error message** from browser console
2. Copy the **backend logs** showing the upload attempt
3. Check if the error happens with all PDFs or just specific ones
4. Try with a simple, small PDF (< 1MB) to rule out file-specific issues

## Summary of Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `backend/main.py` - Enhanced logging and error handling
2. `LexAIScholar/components/PDFUpload.tsx` - Better validation and debugging
3. `LexAIScholar/lib/api.ts` - Comprehensive error reporting

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Environment variable flexibility
- ✅ Stack traces for errors
- ✅ Session validation
- ✅ Network debugging support

The upload should now work correctly, and if it doesn't, you'll have much more information about what's going wrong!
